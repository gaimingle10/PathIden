Visualized script sets for comparing pathogen detection across sequencing platforms (paper under review).

# Disclaimers. All included commands and scripts are written for specific data and therefore are not guaranteed to work on different data sets. These were created to perform specific analyses and were originally intended to meet laboratory requirements, not for commercial or distribution purposes.

R scripts are designed to perform different tasks and can be executed independently by Rscript. \n
